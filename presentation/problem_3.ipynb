    "    a) Read the code carefully and try to understand what it does, line-by-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) Identify any potential errors in the code. Note, don't change the original code snippet! \n",
    "    Instead, add suitable comments adjacent to where any potential sources of error are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c) In a new cell, write a corrected version of the code. Try to make it so that the code\n",
    "    works without changing the given input. You could e.g., try adding some Try/Except blocks in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    d) Prepare to present to to your peers. You will show your original code and explain what the function does and\n",
    "    what errors you've found. Then you will show your corrected code and explain how you've corrected the errors.\n",
    "    Be prepared to answer any questions your peers may have.\n",
